# **ChatGPT**
- Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- An question give provide an Responce
    - Every responce will be difference
    - Have memory, will remember the previous questions and responces
- Common mistakens about chatgpt
    1. ChatGPT is **not** connected to the internet
        - Not search from internet and responces
        - Testing is not connect to internet
        - Training will use internet and taught by humans
- Is a function
    - **文字接龍**， 從機率分佈裡面作取樣然後輸出。
    - 當第一個字已經產生出來後就將其接到到輸入的地方。
- Have memory
    - When you ask a question, it will use previous questions as input and combined the new question after it.
## **Pre-train**
- Also called **Self-supervised Learning** or **Foundation Model**
- How normal ML learn? English to Mandarin as example
    - Use large pairs of english and mandarin sentence and feed into the model. (Supervised learing)
    - Machine will find the **function** f
- Use internet to train the model(pre-train) -- GPT, then do finetune **(supervised learning)** -- ChatGPT
- Multiple language
    - Pre-train with difference language
    - Then do supervised learning (findtune), the model will automatically learnt the others languages
        - All human's languages is the same to ChatGPT, it will transfer all languages into it's language and learn

## **Reinforcement Learning**
- Human give good or bad feedback to model

## **Instruct GPT**
1. Learn 文字接龍
    - Input "你好"
    - Output possible word(s)
        - 從機率分佈中sameple最可能的下一個字
2. 人類引導回答方向
    - 人工標註問題與答案
3. 模仿人類的喜好
    - Teacher model
        - 給每個答案“分數”
4. RL 向 “3” 學習
    - 將 GPT 的 input 與 output 丟給 Teacher model， 然後將 “分數”（reward） 回傳給 GPT
## **How to prompting**
1. Give your needs
2. Correct the problem

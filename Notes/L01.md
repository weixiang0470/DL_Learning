    - Machine will find the **function** f
- Use internet to train the model(pre-train) -- GPT, then do finetune **(supervised learning)** -- ChatGPT
- Multiple language
    - Pre-train with difference language
    - Then do supervised learning (findtune), the model will automatically learnt the others languages
        - All human's languages is the same to ChatGPT, it will transfer all languages into it's language and learn

## **Reinforcement Learning**
- Human give good or bad feedback to model
